# Linear Regression Basics
This repository is a linear regression tutorial compilation in progress. Summary theory cheat sheets of basic linear regression algorithms are given here, along with my implementation codes. The LaTeX explanations in the iPython notebooks can appear broken when viewed directly on Github---but they will show properly on a Jupyter Notebook. 

## Installation Instructions
The codes were created and tested in Python 3.6.3.

Install the basic requirements from terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage Instructions

This file covers
- Simple linear regression
- Multivariate linear regression
- Polynomial linear regression with validation-set based model complexity selection
